If you want a fully fledged install-it-and-forget-it operating system image on NixOS I suggest **GLF OS** although it is still in beta: https://www.gaminglinux.fr/glf-os/en/ 

You can also use **Bazzite** if you want a batteries-included distribution with similar rollback and immutability features to NixOS (at least in practice, they are a very different implementation of immutability). You will not be left wanting and it is one of the most solid and encompassing gaming distros out there. Every time I look at their project they have added some killer features, for example, you can download the mesa-git drivers to a folder (mesa-git are the latest, bleeding edge drivers that have yet to be tested), and only have Steam games use them, while your system is still on the stable drivers. And you do that with one command line **ujust _mesa-git**. My own NixOS configuration took a lot of inspiration from that project. Here is their website: https://bazzite.gg

If you like Arch (btw) then there is **Garuda** or **CachyOS**.

These are just a few of the gaming distros out there, and they are all ready-to-go and easy to use. They are all an easier starting point than my configuration files.
